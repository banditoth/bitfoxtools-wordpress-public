# bitfox toolkit for WordPress feedback site

## Description 
All-in-one WordPress toolkit that replaces a whole stack of small, single-purpose plugins with one lightweight, developer-friendly solution. It bundles everyday essentials for client sites: admin tools, custom roles, SMTP + email log, image optimization, maintenance mode, CSS/JS minify, security hardening and SEO helpers – all from a single, consistent settings panel.

This repository is the public home of the project. Use the Issues tab to report bugs, request new features, or ask for support. When opening an issue, please include your WordPress version, PHP version, and any relevant error messages or screenshots so problems can be reproduced and fixed as quickly as possible.

## How to open an issue (bug, feature request, or support)

Before you create a new ticket, quickly check the existing Issues to see if someone already reported the same thing or requested the same feature. If you find a matching issue, add a comment instead of opening a duplicate.

If you don’t find anything relevant, create a new issue and clearly choose what type it is: bug report, feature request, or support question. Start the title with a short, clear label, for example:
[Bug] WebP not generated on upload or [Feature] Role-based settings presets or [Support] 2FA emails not sending.

In the issue body, please include the following information:

For all issue types, always include:
– A short summary of the problem or request in one or two sentences.
– The plugin version you are using.
– Your WordPress version and PHP version.
– Whether the site is single-site or multisite.
– Your active theme name.
– A short list of other “big” plugins involved (e.g. WooCommerce, major security or cache plugins).

For bug reports, add:
– Exact steps to reproduce the problem, written as a simple sequence: what you clicked, what you changed, where you navigated.
– What you expected to happen.
– What actually happened instead.
– Any error messages from the browser console, PHP error log, or debug log.
– Screenshots or screen recordings if that makes it easier to see.

For feature requests, add:
– What you are trying to achieve in your workflow or for your client.
– Why the current plugin behavior is limiting or inconvenient.
– A clear description of the feature you’d like to see, and if possible, how you imagine it could look or behave in the UI.
– Whether this is a “nice to have” or something you consider critical for using the plugin in production.

For support questions, add:
– What you were trying to do when you got stuck.
– What you have already tried (other plugins disabled, cache cleared, different browser, etc.).
– Any partial results, warnings, or odd behavior you noticed.

Finally, remove any sensitive data (real user emails, IP addresses, license keys, etc.) before posting logs or screenshots. If in doubt, anonymize it.

The more concrete details you include, the easier it is to reproduce and fix problems or consider your feature request seriously.
